                <p>I was born and raised in Southern California but I decided at a very early age that I wanted to see other parts of the country and the world. I decided to join the Peace Corps where I worked in elementary education.</p>

                <p>After the Peace Corps, my husband and I as well as our dogs took various jobs all over the western U.S. After working in Alaska for a year, I decided I was ready to stop living like a gypsy and settle down. I accepted a job teaching Kindergarten in SW Colorado and bought a house. <p>

                <p>I now live in southern Arizona and I have realized that I belong in the southwest. I love the climate, the topography and the diverse bird, plant and animal life.<p>
